# Flow-Network

The project purpose is to compare Ford-Fulkerson method by two different implements to find paths from source vertex
to destination vertex in Flow Network: BFS method, Greedy method.


Operation:
The main function gets a text file name that includes the following parameters:

num of vertexes

num of edges

source vertex

destination vertex

trio of: v-u-capacity

.
.
.

trio of: v-u-capacity

#num of edges trios.

The output is:
BFS Method:
Max flow
Min cut
Number of iterations
Greedy Method:
Max flow
Min Cut
Number of iterations
